        <div id="started"><h2>Getting Started</h2><p><strong>Before you can win, you must be officially registered in the competition. Fortunately, you can do that in about 5 minutes from your phone or computer.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <ol><li><em><strong>Register on the website</strong></em>. When registering <img alt="" class="attr__format__media_large img__fid__159 img__view_mode__media_large media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/styles/large/public/AllAtOnce.png?itok=pPXTkRFG" style="box-shadow:none; float:right; height:241px; width:289px">we <u><em><strong>highly</strong></em></u> recommend using your <em><strong>LinkedIN</strong></em>, <em><strong>Google+</strong></em>, or <em><strong>Facebook</strong></em> account to speed up the process. After logging in the first time, you will be asked a few questions about yourself, starting with general questions like your name, etc.,&nbsp; and then more specific questions about your class,&nbsp;major, and skills &amp; experience. &nbsp;<strong><em>You will not be registered to compete until your profile is complete</em>. </strong>If your registration gets interrupted, you can resume&nbsp;it by logging in again by the same method you used before. The system will then prompt you to complete your registration.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong><em>Confirm your eligibility to win</em></strong>. The eligibility&nbsp;rules are given in the <a href="">Rules &amp; Policies</a> section of the Competitors Guide. Please free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> to discuss any questions about your eligibility.</li>
          <li><em><strong>Polish up your public directory profile</strong>.</em> Once registered, you can take your time spiffing up your public profile that will be published in the competition directory. <strong>Log in using whatever method (LinkedIN, Google+, Facebook, username/password) you used to register.</strong> (Note: this is <em>very</em> important; if you choose another method then you may end up with two accounts and lots of confusion later on.) Then you can change your picture, craft your skills &amp; experience entry, and even add social links to your profile listing. (Instructions for each of these things are given in the FAQs.)</li>
          <li><em><strong>Ask lots of questions.</strong></em> There is a lot of material here on the website, which can make things confusing sometimes, especially in the beginning. So speak up when that happens! Your questions will help us make it better for you and everyone who comes after you. If you don't know who to ask, use our <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page to email your question, and we'll get it to the right person.&nbsp;</li>

    <div id="homework"><h2>The Winning Game Plan</h2><h3>Do Your Homework</h3><p>Once you have successfully registered for the competition, start building your foundation by familiarizing yourself with all aspects of the competition. Begin by checking out the various <a href="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbp/rules">rules of the game</a> (eligibility requirements, submission deadlines, etc.) and thinking up some business ideas that could be developed into business plans.</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__212 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/Tracks_0.jpg" style="display:block; float:right; height:158px; margin:10px; width:280px">As you work on these initial ideas keep in mind that there are two <a href="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbp/tracks"><em>different parallel tracks</em></a> for the competition, the <strong><em>Venture</em></strong> <strong>Track</strong> and the <strong><em>Social</em> Track</strong>. Each track has a different focus, requirements, and (ultimately) judging criteria that determine who wins. And no, you can't enter both tracks or be on multiple teams, so you really do have to make a choice. Fortunately, you don't have to make that choice until the team formation deadline in Feburary.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, you might want to spend a little time sanity-checking your ideas:</p>
      <ul><li>Does success depend on some sort of technical innovation? If so, can you get to market in time to exploit your advantage? Can you sell the idea to someone else instead?</li>
        <li>Are there already competitors for your new business? If so, how successful are they? Can you expect to do as well?</li>
        <li>Will your idea require a lot of up front time and money to implement or can you build gradually from a minimal viable product? ...</li>
      </ul><p>Often these kinds of questions are pretty easy to answer with only a modest amount of research. By coming up with the business ideas and then subjecting them to the most basic sanity checking <em>before</em> you commit to developing them, you will save yourself a lot of time, money, and effort. It will also allow you to consider more ideas. After all, it's extremely rare for the first idea to be the big one that makes a business, so expect to generate lots of ideas before finding a truly successful one.</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_large img__fid__210 img__view_mode__media_large media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/styles/large/public/_MG_4943.jpg?itok=4f3dAuYs" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
      <p>To get a feel for what kinds of questions to ask and what it takes to win, <strong>peruse some finished business plans and watch a few winning pitches from other competitions</strong>. There are plenty of them out there on the web. We also have the luxury of having several past winners of our competition here on campus. If you ask, they may be willing to share their winning plans and pitches with you.</p>
      <p>What if you don't have a great idea or the time to develop one? Then work with somebody who does! Or maybe just attend the events to learn what it takes to start a business. <strong>You do not have to win a prize to be a winner. You just have to accomplish what <em>you </em>set out to do.</strong></p>
      
    </div>
    
    <div id="build"><h3>Build Your Network</h3> <p>No startup is ever a solo effort, even when the company has just one employee. Rather, every company relies on a network of people and other resources to survive and grow. As you participate in this year's competition, you will also find that having friends and leveraging resources is key to finding success.</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__233 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbp/sites/default/files/media/FBPC_TImeline.png" style="max-width:100%"></p>
      <p>The best way to build your network is to plug into the many events that take place over the months leading up to the Finale. Many of these, like the Kickoff in September, Startup Day in November, are listed on the competition calendar. However, there are other events outside the competition that can be just as important. For example, the <a href="http://www.inventus.org/">Inventors Association of Connecticut</a> (IACT) holds its monthly meetings right here on campus. Similarly, <a href="http://www.up.co/">Up Global </a>holds several <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> events in and around Connecticut thoughout the year. Fairfield University hosted one this past June that drew over 100 entrepreneurs, mentors, and advisors; $29K in prizes was split between the winning teams. Finally, there are University-sponsored seminars, webinars, and other similar events every semester that might provide a unique networking opportunity.</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__215 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/IACT_logo.png" style="height:100px; width:200px"><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__216 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/StartupWeekend.png" style="height:80px; width:204px"></p>
      <p>As you engage in these events, and interact with individuals who can potentially help you, concentrate on making a professional impression in order to cement these contacts as members of your expanding network. <strong>Be proactive, introducing yourself to individuals and to groups, when given the opportunity. In addition to face-to-face interaction, pay close attention to e-mail and other written communication that so often makes up the majority of our professional contact these days.&nbsp; </strong>Sometimes a simple follow-up email to a new acquaintance can make all the difference!&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__227 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/Networking.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
      <p>Lastly, record the connections that you make by collecting business cards and adding profiles to your contacts list. Also, whenever possible, seek to make a connection through invites to join your network on LinkedIn. There is a very good chance that these individuals will become a valuable part of your professional connections for years to come.</p>
      <p>To help you plan and keep track of your network, we provide two online tools on the competition website:</p>
      <ul><li>The <a href="connect.html">Directory</a> (listed in the About menu), where you will find pictures, bios, and other information for all of the competition organizers, mentors, judges, and partners. Note: full directory access, including listings of student registrants, is restricted to registered users only, so please regsiter if haven't already.</li>
        <li>The <a href="connect.html">Partner Board</a>, where you can post and read Craigslist-style <em>Partner Requests</em> for yourself or your team. We will make heavy use of the Partner Board on Startup Day, which formally kicks off the team formation process.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="teamformation"><h3>Form Your Team</h3> <p>When it comes to forming the right team for any successful entrepreneurial endeavor, it is always best to bring together <strong>individuals who complement one another, </strong>and the same applies to successful teams in the Fairfield Business Plan Competition. Successful teams will have typically assembled a group whose individual skill-sets aggregate to having all of the important bases covered.</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__218 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/BluStrip.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
      <p>It is strongly recommended that you step outside of your individual major (finance major? … find a marketer!!) and/or step outside of your school (business major? … find an engineer!!) to assemble a well-rounded team. Not only will you function better in the context of this competition, but you will also be mimicking a practice that is important to “real world investors," asking and answering the question: <strong><em>Does this group of individuals fill in all of the skills-gaps that will be required to make this endeavor a success?</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Equally important, take note of things you don’t like in potential teammates, and have that impact your final team formation as well.</p>
      <p><strong>The team formation deadline is in early February. </strong>(See front page calendar for exact date). Use the first few months leading up to the deadline to “audition” potential teammates that you would like to join your team. Suggestions: try the <a href="connect.html">Partner Board</a> and use the Fall contests to connect and work with potential partners.</p>
      <p>Your <strong>ideal team</strong> will have partners who (a) you will enjoy working with, (b) bring something to the table to contribute skills that complement your own, and (c) bring a work ethic and commitment to the competition that will help the team ultimately prevail.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="workmentor"><h3>Work with a Mentor</h3> <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__228 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/Willkehr.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
      <p>In keeping with any successful entrepreneurial process, <strong>one of the most valuable (...and efficient!) resources you can tap into</strong> is that of an <em><strong>experienced mentor</strong></em>. We have enlisted a roster of mentors who are eager to support competing groups. Drawn by the energy and excitement that comes from students who are working together to bring their respective venture-concepts to life, under the "real life" simulation that the competition is framed around, these mentors are eager to participate.</p>
      <p><strong>WHAT IS A FAIRFIELD BUSINESS PLAN COMPETITION MENTOR?</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Someone with experience, ideally related to your group's venture-concept.</li>
        <li>Someone who has chosen to contribute their time and energy to be available to your group as a resource, to whatever degree you choose to engage them.</li>
        <li>Someone who ends up taking a personal and professional interest in seeing your group succeed.</li>
        <li>Based on the last two years of competition, someone who can be identified as a difference-maker, resulting in a greater likelihood of winning the competition.</li>
      </ul><p><strong>HOW DO YOU GET A MENTOR? </strong></p>
      <p>Easy...as there are a few ways to go. First, scan the profiles of individuals listed in the <a href="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbp/directory?rid=8"><strong>Mentor List</strong></a>, looking for someone with the right combination of experience and background that aligns most closely with your venture-concept. Secondly, <strong>attend the early events</strong> in the competition, where you will be able to "shop" for your mentor through personal interaction and asking questions of the mentors who will also be in attendance. And lastly, if none of the current mentors work for you, you are invited to <strong>recruit your own mentor</strong> (....just making sure they officially register as a mentor on the website once they commit to supporting your group).</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__222 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/_MG_5046.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
      <p>It is <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</strong> that your group connect with a mentor early in the process, in order to harvest the greatest value of this resource. The biggest venture improvement opportunities usually happen early in the shaping of your concept. A mentor can provide valuable insight and feedback across the entire spectrum of the entrepreneurial process, from initial viability assessment and concept shaping and positioning, all the way through to the formal writing of the business plan and preparing for final presentations to judges....but their greatest impact is often felt early on.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="consult"><h3>Consult the Experts</h3> <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__223 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/2013_judges.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"></p>
      <p>Another valuable step in every entrepreneurial endeavor is <strong>to reach out to sources of expertise</strong>&nbsp;in order to collect specialized&nbsp;information that will help you shape and ultimately market your product or service effectively. Different than ongoing relationships of mentors, experts have knowledge that you want to capture and leverage through single interactions.</p>
      <p>Besides the potential impact on the quality of your business plan itself, citing the work of experts can also lend legitimacy to your claims that would be hard to get any other way. It show potential investors that the business venture they are being invited to invest in has been built on the solid analytical foundation.</p>
      <p>Sources of expertise take <strong>two broad forms</strong>:</p>
      <ul><li>first-hand interaction with professionals in the field, and</li>
        <li>research, largely conducted online and through the library</li>
      </ul><p>When interacting directly with an <strong>expert in the field</strong>, respect the individual’s time; you might not get a second chance. Be prepared to laser focus on the issues you want to work on. Listen closely, while documenting your conversation, in order to effectively explore and integrate the advice given. Remember, these are people who have expertise that you don't have, so leverage any and all time you can get from them.</p>
      <p><img alt="" class="attr__format__media_original img__fid__229 img__view_mode__media_original media-image" src="http://is-dsb.fairfield.edu/fbpc2014/sites/default/files/media/ReferenceDesk.jpg" style="float:right; height:200px; width:300px">Of all the resources provided to you, perhaps the easiest to access is the <strong>reference desk at the library</strong>. There is an extraordinary trove of databases to search for information pertaining to every entrepreneurial endeavor you can think of … and they are all available to you for free through the Fairfield University library system.</p>
      <p>So, when confronted with a seemingly intractible problem, don't just sit there waiting for inpiration. Research the issue, ask lots of questions, and <em>then</em> come up with your own analysis.</p>
